### Hi there 👋

Marketing has provided me with the basics to understand what should be on a website and how to optimize it, studying web development has allowed me to create it from scratch, to observe its processes, and to be fascinated by them, but also to open my mind even more, towards a world made not only of code but also of incredible discoveries and enthusiasm 😍

Thanks to Boolean, the most famous tech academy in Italy, I've been able to learn the logics and tools necessary for web development: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Vite, Node.js, and I'm enthusiastic about learning new ones, especially Angular and React. I am eager to put into practice what I have learned and have the opportunity to learn even more 💪
