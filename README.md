### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm a passionate web developer 
fueled by curiosity and a drive for continuous learning. 
With a solid foundation in marketing and web development skills acquired from Boolean, Italy's renowned tech academy, 
I thrive on bringing ideas to life through code. From crafting websites with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to 
exploring advanced frameworks like Vue.js and Node.js, I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. 
Currently, I'm excited to delve deeper into Angular and React to expand my expertise further. Let's connect, collaborate, 
and create together in this dynamic world of technology and innovation! ðŸš€
